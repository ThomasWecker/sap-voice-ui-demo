# A simple voice ui demo with Alexa and SAP S/4HANA

## Introduction
On a warm day in 2018, I ran into my then VP after a workshop. We talked about the upcoming trade conference where he wanted to present the company's path to implementing SAP S/4HANA. Yesterday the frontend team showed me a small PoC by integrating Alexa into the consumer app. Something like this with SAP would be great for the conference. Why can't we do this with S/4HANA?
Well...challange accepted ðŸ’ª

I would like to share the result with you here. :smiley:
